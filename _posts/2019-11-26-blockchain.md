title:  "Chromebook Adventures: Web & Blockchain Development"

Discovering the various capabilities, limitations, and quirks of Chrome OS & Crostini has been quite interesting. A typical environment right now involves running a React development server for front-end web development and a Ganache server for Ethereum blockchain development.

Occasionally, the Crostini system will bog down because of the processing and memory limitations...but that is currently my only complaint.

Side note: the Chromebook Go was recently announced with up to 16GB RAM, 25GB storage, Core i7 processor, and 4k screen. These things are starting to tackle the big players in the PC world.
