title:  "Chromebook Adventures: Beginnings"
---

The big question: _can a Chromebook survive the rigors of university life?_ More specifically, the last semester of an aerospace engineering program with various coding projects.

After going through most of my life with Windows computers (from 98 to 10, and everything in between), I wanted a laptop that was lighter in hardware and software.

Windows machines had fairly large dimensions and the software was bogged down with various pieces of legacy "bloatware". The linux subsystem was a not a good replacement because it was simply too slow to use.

Dual-booting was a good temporary solution but it was a little difficult to access files between the two different OS, and occasionally the linux system needed to be reinstalled.

Mac OS products were never really in consideration due to cost and just my personal preferences on a more open ecosystem.

Enter Chromebooks: based on the open-source Chromium project, built on top of a linux system, small form-factor hardware, fairly large battery life, and highly optimized for running a Chrome browser. Typically seen as a simple machine to browse the web and run a few small applications, the Crostini project containerizes the Debian 9 subsystem and opens up a whole new level of functionality. Basically, a whole linux system integrated into the Chrome OS system.

So we shall see how this goes...

Chromebook specifications:
- Samsung Chromebook Plus (V2)
- Intel Celeron
