Let's just say gaming together is a great way to stay connected with people, especially right now. Though I'm not much of a gamer, good part games are definitely well appreciated. So Jackbox has been a great source of laughter and bonding during this time. All you need is a computer and a phone - it's really that simple.

The tricky part was sharing everything over the internet. But I have been using Daily.co which has a web-UI for video chatting, personalized URLs, and rooms that the user can maintain. It's also got an API - so it basically hits all of my video chatting needs and gets into my coder curiosity.

In terms of testing, it has worked out pretty well to video chat with 5 total devices with one streaming the game - between Toronto, Ontario and Ann Arbor, Michigan. And for a Chromebook, I honestly can't ask for much more. Definitely no hard-core, GPU intensive games on this machine.
