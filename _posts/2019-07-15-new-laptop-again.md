The answer is yes - a Chromebook can do it; but...

Storage is an issue that I should have seen coming. Crostini cannot access the 128 GB microSD card that I inserted - it can only use local storage which is unfortunate because I only had 32 GB to work with. Eventually it took nearly 20 GB of space, and the rest of it belonged to the actual ChromeOS system. Then it was daily reminders that I was running low on memory.

In other news, the Crostini container is fantastic - an actively developed Debian 9 container where functionality is consistently being built that is smoothly integrated into the rest of the operating system. Easily runs Atom as a text editor, Python for various programming projects, and LaTeX for compiling reports.

But again, the memory issues - so I needed to upgrade: same exterior and RAM, a little better processor, four times the storage.

Chromebook specifications:
- Samsung Chromebook Plus (V2)
- Intel Core M3
- 128 GB eMMC storage
- 4 GB RAM
